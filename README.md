## Project Description
Grouper is an app that gives users the freedom to engage in a live chat 
either with there account or anonymously. 

Once a user is logged in they are given the ability to create different chat rooms ( aka groups ). 
Other users are then allowed to jump in those groups and engage in a live discussion.

Our platform is designed to give people the power to express there views in a way that wouldn't 
limit there speech. And Grouper is that platform.
